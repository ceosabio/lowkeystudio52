this Saturday I turn 45, I'm excited about this because I'm at a point in life where it finally seems like I'll be able to enjoy life.  Not that I don't enjoy life now, but I really do see myself thriving and living and loving every single minute of my existence.  It has alot to do with this career change, my divorce settlement modification and again, the transition from the education industry to the tech web development industry.  I thank God each and every day for my blessings.
